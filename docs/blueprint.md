## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark olive green (#556B2F) for a military-inspired feel.
- Background color: Light khaki (#F0E68C) with a low saturation (around 20%) to maintain a subtle, neutral tone, as befits an admininstrative app.
- Accent color: Dark brown (#8B4513) for interactive elements and important calls to action, chosen to be distinct from both primary and background while keeping within a related palette.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a modern humanist sans-serif, to be used for both headlines and body text, with appropriate weights set via CSS. Suitable for a military/administrative context.
- Responsive layout to ensure accessibility on Android devices.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent personnel status (present, absent, on mission, on permission).
- Subtle transitions when updating dashboard numbers and generating reports.
