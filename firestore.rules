/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access to all data, but restricts write access.
 * Currently, all write operations are denied, reflecting a read-only state.
 * As the application evolves, write rules must be added to specific collections based on authentication and authorization requirements.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /personnel/{personnelId}: Stores information about personnel members.
 * - /attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores attendance records, with IDs as composites of personnelId and date.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No write access is granted in the current ruleset.
 * - Read access is open to all users.
